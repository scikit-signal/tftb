==================================================================
Spectrogram of Parallel Chirps with Short Gaussian Analysis Window
==================================================================

This example visualizes the spectrogram of two "parallel" chirps, using a
Gaussian window function that has a short length, relative to the length of a
signal. The two chirps can be made out, but interference can also be seen along
the frequency axis, since frequency resolution is compromised.

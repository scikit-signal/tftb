===================================================================
Spectrogram of Parallel Chirps with a Long Gaussian Analysis Window
===================================================================

This example visualizes the spectrogram of two "parallel" chirps, using a
Gaussian window function that has a long length, relative to the length of a
signal. The two chirps can be made out, but interference can also be seen along
the time axis, since time resolution is compromised.

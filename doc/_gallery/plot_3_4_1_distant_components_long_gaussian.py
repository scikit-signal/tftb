===================================================
Distant Chirps with a Long Gaussian Analysis Window
===================================================

This example visualizes a spectrogram of two chirp signals which are well
separated in frequency ranges. A longer Gaussian analysis window suffices here
to see the separation of frequencies, since the variation in frequencies is
relatively slow.
